# Abstract

The objective of this project is to create an app of Rock Paper Scissor game, played using images of human hands. The game will take a photo of the player's hand and identify the symbol made, then use this as input to get the game result.
There will be 2 playing modes: Vs CPU and Vs player.

To obtain the symbol made by the player, we are going to apply filters to enhance the image and then use it in a classifier.
